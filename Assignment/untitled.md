# Financial Report

## **Budget Analysis**

From looking at this individual, we can conclude that they are spending far above their means. They are making $500 a month, with a projected yearly income of $6,085

Their spending habits are crazy! From the data I pulled, we can see that they are spending over $10,000 each month. Represented by the chart below. Please note April is low due to not pulling in all the transactions in April, I only pulled in the data from the past 90 days.

 I've also compiled a pie chart below detailing their spending habits over the past 90 days. We can see this individual is transfering a lot of money somewhere.

 In conclusion, this individual is making only $500 dollars a month with a history of spending over $10,000 each month. Yet somehow he is still surviving, my recommendation would be to report him to the IRS as I suspect there's some money laudering here with the high transaction rates he has.
